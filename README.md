# Power BI Dashboards for Talent and Company Data Analysis

## Description

This Power BI project contains two dashboards designed for administrators to analyze data related to Talents and Companies within a back-office system.  These dashboards are built to provide insights into key data points to support data-driven decision-making for talent and company management.

This project is part of a larger initiative to establish a robust user and job data management system.  These dashboards are designed to visualize data imported and managed within this system, such as experience levels, job titles, skills, job configurations, and training data.

## Dashboards Included

This project includes the following dashboards:

* **Talent Data Analysis Dashboard:**
    *  Provides an interface for administrators to view and analyze data specifically related to talents within the system.
    *  Focuses on metrics and visualizations relevant to understanding talent pools, skill distribution, experience levels, and other talent-related attributes.

* **Company Data Analysis Dashboard:**
    *  Offers an interface for administrators to view and analyze data related to companies in the system.
    *  Provides insights into company demographics, industry distribution, and potentially company-specific performance indicators (depending on the data available in the system).

## Data Sources (Implied)

These dashboards connect to a PostgreSQL database that is part of the back-office system. This database contains the Talent and Company data mentioned before, including:

* **Talent Data:** Experience levels, job titles, skills, training data, etc.
* **Company Data:** Company demographics, industry information, etc.

## Context

These dashboards are developed as part of a sprint focused on establishing a foundation for user and job data management within a back-office system.  This sprint successfully:

* Imported key data like experience levels and job titles.
* Secured admin login procedures.
* Streamlined workflows for managing skills, job configurations, and training data.
* Created clear visual documentation for development.

These achievements lay the groundwork for a robust user and job data management system in future sprints, and these dashboards are a key component for data analysis within that system.
